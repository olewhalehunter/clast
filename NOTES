20150114 ANSI operators defined as macros.
------------------------------------------

There are several operators in the ANSI spec that are defined as
'macros'; the iteration constructs are such -- DOLIST, DOTIMES, DO,
DO*, LOOP.

It would make sense to have MACRO-APPLICATION as a superclass of,
e.g., LOOP-FORM in order to list them later as actual macros when
calling MACROS.

This would complicate the construction of the iteration form instances
and other as well.  A different implementation choice would be to work
on MAP-SUBFORMS or on the calls to WALK.
